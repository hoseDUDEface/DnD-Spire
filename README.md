# Default Mod Base -  Only Relics

This branch removes the characters, cards, events, and potions from the standard default base, in case you wanted to exclusively make a relic mod.

It still keeps a couple of potential necessities, such as powers, actions, orbs, patches, etc.

If you wanted to add some cards/events/potions/etc. on top, feel free to take a look at how they're implemented in the master branch, or any other "only" branch.

Happy modding!
